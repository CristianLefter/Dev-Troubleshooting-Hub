# Backtick Key Issue in Windows

## Problem Description
Users have reported an issue with the backtick key in Windows 11, where pressing the backtick key twice is required to enter a single backtick (`) and it appears as double backticks (``). This can be a hindrance for those who frequently use the backtick key in their work for example when editing markdown files and entering a code section.

## Solution
The solution to this issue has been found to be switching to the English (United States) language. This resolves the issue and allows the backtick key to function as expected.

## Steps to Solve
1. Go to the Windows Start menu and click on the "Settings" icon.
2. In the Settings window, click on "Time & Language".
3. In the Time & Language settings, click on "Language".
4. Under "Preferred languages", click on "English (United States)".
5. Click on "Set as default".
